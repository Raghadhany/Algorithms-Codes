*Missing codes -> Merge sort for strings and char in arr of characters*
1-  (insertion sort - selection sort(recursive) - selection sort(iterative) - merge sort ) to sort string or sort  character in array of character
2-  GCD(Euclid’s algorithm using only subtractions - consective integer checking algorithm.)
3-  Design an algorithm for computing the value of a polynomial at a point x, which runs in time that is at most O (n) in the worst case.(ابحث عنه في الشيتات)
5-  Design an algorithm to find all the common elements in two sorted lists of numbers. For example, for the lists 2, 5, 5, 5 and 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, the output should be 2, 5, 5. What is the maximum number of comparisons your algorithm makes if the lengths of the two given lists are m and n, respectively?.
7-  Write c++ code for a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the position of the largest element in an array of n numbers.
8-  binary search or sequential search (iterative or recursive) about character in string
