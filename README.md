1-  (insertion sort - selection sort(recursive) - selection sort(iterative) - merge sort ) to sort string or sort  character in array of character <br />
<br/>
2-  GCD(Euclid‚Äôs algorithm using only subtractions - consective integer checking algorithm.) <br />
<br/>
3-  Design an algorithm for computing the value of a polynomial at a point x, which runs in time that is at most O (n) in the worst case. <br />
<br/>
5-  Design an algorithm to find all the common elements in two sorted lists of numbers. For example, for the lists 2, 5, 5, 5 and 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, the output should be 2, 5, 5. <br/>
What is the maximum number of comparisons your algorithm makes if the lengths of the two given lists are m and n, respectively? <br />
<br/>
7-  Write c++ code for a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the position of the largest element in an array of n numbers. <br />
<br/>
8-  binary search or sequential search (iterative or recursive) about character in string <br />
